## Getting Started
To view my page, view **https://alexpollack0.github.io/tamidsite/**
The main purpose in creating this website was to put together an easy-to-understand and customizable template that chapters can use to code their own sites and edit when necessary.

To pull the code from this repo into your own directory, create a new directory (folder), and type in **git clone https://github.com/alexpollack0/tamidsite.git**

I've added commented numbers to the code so please follow the number guide in the readme as you alter the code.

**The repo only contains 2 html files: full.html and index.html.**  index.html is simply a minified version of full.html.  I'll explain more about what this means later on but for now, don't worry about index.html.

This readme is split up into 3 sections: HTML (content), CSS (style), and hosting

## Section 1.1: Landing Page
